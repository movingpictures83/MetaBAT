# MetaBAT
# Language: C++
# Dependency: Requires the MetaBAT software to be installed and in the system PATH.
# Input: TXT (list of files)
# Output: prefix (for multiple files to be generated)

PluMA plugin to run MetaBAT (Kang et al, 2015) (generated by PluGen).
MetaBAT accepts as input a FASTA file that contains contigs, and any number
of binary BAM files that contain sequence data.  The software then
generates output bins using a prefix.

This plugin accepts as input a TXT file in the following format:

<FASTA file for contigs>
<BAM file, sample 1>
<BAM file, sample 2>
....

It will then automatically run MetaBAT with these arguments, and generate
bins using the prefix specified as the "outputfile" argument for the plugin.
